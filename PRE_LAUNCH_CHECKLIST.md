   - Time: 30 minutes

3. **Add Error Tracking**
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Tool: Sentry or similar
   - Impact: Better debugging in production
   - Time: 1 hour

4. **Set Up Analytics**
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Tool: Google Analytics or Plausible
   - Impact: Understand user behavior
   - Time: 1 hour

### Optional (Nice to Have)
